2. Type: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
3. Look for your local IP address

### Step 2: Update the IP Address

2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   MUSIC_SERVER_URL: 'http://192.168.1.100:3001', // Change this to your PC's IP
   ```
3. Replace `192.168.1.100` with your actual IP address
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart the App

1. Stop your Expo app (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart it: `npx expo start`
3. The music player should now connect to your server

2. Go to: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/api/songs`

- `192.168.1.xxx` (most common)
